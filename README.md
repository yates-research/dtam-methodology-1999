## [cite_start]Abstract [cite: 13]

[cite_start]A digital tectonic and volcanic map of the world was created which integrates numerous remotely sensed and GIS databases[cite: 13]. [cite_start]This integrative technique made it possible to analyze data differentiated by spatial and temporal resolutions[cite: 14]. [cite_start]The remotely sensed data ranged from 9 kilometers to 30-meters resolution[cite: 15]. [cite_start]The GIS datasets ranged in scale from 1:1,000,000 to 1:24,000[cite: 16]. [cite_start]The scope of the digital database was the geologic present, restricted to geological events that have taken place in the last million years[cite: 18, 19]. [cite_start]The data, totaling 5 gigabytes, integrated satellite sea-surface altimetry, volcanoes, seismicity, Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), ground base records, and a digital terrain model[cite: 20]. [cite_start]This tectonic activity database may be used to produce maps highlighting geological activities with user-defined ranges of time, locality, severity, and topography[cite: 23]. [cite_start]The database can be easily modified to facilitate the inclusion of additional supplementary information and new seismic or volcanic observations[cite: 24].
