## Abstract

A digital tectonic and volcanic map of the world was created which integrates numerous remotely sensed and GIS databases. This integrative technique made it possible to analyze data differentiated by spatial and temporal resolutions. The remotely sensed data ranged from 9 kilometers to 30-meters resolution. The GIS datasets ranged in scale from 1:1,000,000 to 1:24,000. The scope of the digital database was the geologic present, restricted to geological events that have taken place in the last million years. The data, totaling 5 gigabytes, integrated satellite sea-surface altimetry, volcanoes, seismicity, Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), ground base records, and a digital terrain model.

## Key Technologies and Methods

* **GIS Software**: Used commercially available software ARCVIEW and PCI.
* **Data Integration**: Utilized an integrative technique for discrete tectonic datasets to accommodate differences in data structure and format (text, vector, and raster).
* **Data Processing**: Employed UNIX commands such as "awk," "cp," and "sed" for manipulating ASCII text files and formatting data for analysis.
* **Datasets**: Worked with seismicity, volcanism, bathymetry, topography, and geodetic VLBI data.
