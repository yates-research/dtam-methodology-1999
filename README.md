## Abstract

[cite_start]A digital tectonic and volcanic map of the world was created which integrates numerous remotely sensed and GIS databases. [cite: 13] [cite_start]This integrative technique made it possible to analyze data differentiated by spatial and temporal resolutions. [cite: 14] [cite_start]The remotely sensed data ranged from 9 kilometers to 30-meters resolution. [cite: 15] [cite_start]The GIS datasets ranged in scale from 1:1,000,000 to 1:24,000. [cite: 16] [cite_start]The scope of the digital database was the geologic present, restricted to geological events that have taken place in the last million years. [cite: 18, 19] [cite_start]The data, totaling 5 gigabytes, integrated satellite sea-surface altimetry, volcanoes, seismicity, Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), ground base records, and a digital terrain model. [cite: 20]

## Key Technologies and Methods

* [cite_start]**GIS Software**: Used commercially available software ARCVIEW and PCI. [cite: 50]
* [cite_start]**Data Integration**: Utilized an integrative technique for discrete tectonic datasets to accommodate differences in data structure and format (text, vector, and raster). [cite: 33, 46]
* [cite_start]**Data Processing**: Employed UNIX commands such as "awk," "cp," and "sed" for manipulating ASCII text files and formatting data for analysis. [cite: 51]
* [cite_start]**Datasets**: Worked with seismicity, volcanism, bathymetry, topography, and geodetic VLBI data. [cite: 31]
